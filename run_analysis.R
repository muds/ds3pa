# Function:
#   tidyDataFromZip
#
# Description:
#   Extracts testing and training data from the Samsung dataset stored
#   in the .zip archive specified by `zipfile`, and merges them into a
#   single dataset. Activity names are read from the `activity_labels.txt`
#   file in the archive and added as a factor. Column descriptions for
#   the measured quantities are generated based on the list contained in
#   `features.txt`, and those that have previously been aggregated and
#   identified as either `-mean()` or `-std()` are combined into a new,
#   intermediate dataset. These features are then further aggregated,
#   to find the single value that is the mean of each one, over all
#   measurements for a single subject and a single activity.
#
# Input:
#   None
#
# Output:
#   Returns a data.frame object containing average mean and average
#   standard deviation for each of the measured properties, over each
#   subject's performance of each activity.

  # Function:
  #   combineFiles
  #
  # Description:
  #   Extracts the two files, `ftest` and `ftrain`, from the archive
  #   `zipfile`, and appends one to the other via `rbind`. Optionally
  #   sets the column names in the returned data set to those given
  #   in the `cnames` parameter, if any.
  #
  # Input:
  #   `ftest`, `ftrain` (character) -
  #     The path and filename within the `zipfile` archive of the
  #     testing and training datasets to be combined.
  #   `cnames` (optional, character vector) -
  #     Names to be applied to the columns in the output.
  #
  # Output:
  #   A data frame containing both the testing and training data from
  #   one pair of files in the Samsung data.
